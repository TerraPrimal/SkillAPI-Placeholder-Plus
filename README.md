# SkillAPI-Placeholder-Plus
Extra PlaceholderAPI Placeholders For SkillAPI!

This plugin was created due to a few people wanting it and the SkillAPI developer not being interested in adding to the the basic expansion.
This should be fairly future proof. I may add requested variables but prefer to keep my spaghetti code off spigot.
